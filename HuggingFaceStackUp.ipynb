        "**Introduction**\n",
        "In this quest, you will take your skills to the next level by building a dynamic chat agent using the Llama 2 model from Hugging Face Transformers. Unlike a basic chatbot, this chat agent will first check if the question has a predefined answer in a QA dataset, and if not, it will generate a response using the Llama 2 model.\n",
        "\n",
        "The agent will also automatically update the dataset with new Q&A pairs, ensuring that it becomes more knowledgeable over time. By integrating Gradio, you’ll create an interactive user interface for your chat agent, making it accessible and user-friendly.\n",
        "This quest will equip you with practical experience in handling both structured (QA dataset) and unstructured (LLM-based responses) data sources, as well as deploying an AI-powered chat service.\n",
